# BINGO – Game Rules (GameBox)

Bingo is a game of chance where players match numbers on their grid with numbers called by the active player.

## 🏁 How to Play

1.  **Setup Phase**:
    -   You have **10 seconds** to fill your grid.
    -   You can either **Randomize** the grid or **Manually** fill it by clicking/dragging numbers.
    -   If you don't finish in time, the remaining slots will be filled randomly.

2.  **Playing Phase**:
    -   One player is chosen to start.
    -   On your turn, you must **pick a number** from your grid to "call" it.
    -   Once a number is called, **all players** (including you) must mark that number on their own grid.
    -   You have a limited time to mark the number!

3.  **Claiming B-I-N-G-O**:
    -   Complete a full **row, column, or diagonal** to claim a BINGO letter.
    -   Letters are claimed in order: **B → I → N → G → O**.
    -   Completing multiple lines at once claims multiple letters.

## 🏆 Winning the Game

-   The first player to claim all five letters (**B-I-N-G-O**) wins!
-   If multiple players complete BINGO at the same time, the one who completed it on the earlier turn wins.
